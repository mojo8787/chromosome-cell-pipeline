abstract: >
  A combined genomics and microscopy analysis pipeline demonstrating
  end-to-end Hi-C chromatin analysis and nuclei segmentation, with
  AI-powered phenotype analysis (OpenAI Vision, structured outputs).
  Built for reproducibility, public deployment, and alignment with
  chromosome organization research (e.g., HiCognition at the Gerlich lab, IMBA).

  "description": "A combined genomics and microscopy analysis pipeline demonstrating end-to-end Hi-C chromatin analysis and nuclei segmentation. Uses cooltools/cooler for Hi-C (compatible with HiCognition) and StarDist for nuclei segmentation. Includes AI-powered phenotype analysis (OpenAI Vision) with structured outputs. Streamlit dashboard with sidebar navigation, rate limiting, and public deployment support. Built for reproducibility and alignment with chromosome organization research.",
